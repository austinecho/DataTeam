2-Week review - Take #1
-------------------------------

Below are discrepancies for last 2 weeks on all tasks\projects and planned\unplanned items.
Main focus here is to recognize patterns where we could improve on our day-to-day activities
and projects overall.

Conclusion: 
		Improvement -> do not start on projects before its definition. Analyzing project before full understanding on priority and high level tasks is a no go.
		Overall: Thumbs UP!! Most of the code reviews are handled properly and on time. Consultation requests are also being handled quickly.
		Thank you Team!!
