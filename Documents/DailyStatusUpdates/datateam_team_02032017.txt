Kenton:

Distraction: 

Austin: 
1.) Finish Ulitpro - INC0207181
2.) Mira Im Data Consultation (have list of columns and tables, removing invalid columns and tables from list then sending results)
	Did not complete today, created scriprt to find FKs of tblCustomer and then finds the FKs of found tables until it finds all.
	Also, it will take more manual work to make sure we aren't left with orphan data that doesn't use FKs. Example, tblCustomerCosts has a CustomerGUID and tblCustomerCostLineItems has a CustomerCostID field that references that table.
3.) Data Quality
4.) Support reports in QA2
5.) Incident INC0206192 - Kaman 364 Branch
