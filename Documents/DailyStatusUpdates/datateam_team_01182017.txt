Corey: handle echoquote trunk failures. 

* In the process of preparing an EchoQuoteArchive document in preparation for my Friday meeting with Liz.  She asked a few questions in response to the meeting invite, so I want to make sure I cover everything for her ( current issues, growth trends, archive plans)
* GP - Security issues in Command GP, requests from Marilyn, updating statistics on 63 tables in EGL database (will be performed after hours)
* SQL Jobs Inventory - Started looking through a few SQL jobs on DB02 to determine its purpose.

Past tense (actions\tasks taken that were not planned):
----------------------------------------------------------

Jasmin and Jonna: met with Daniel (HR) -> Caide will most likely start on 3/13 due to complications for his last 2 week payout once he gives notice.
I think this is OK due to fact he is expected to hit the ground running as Senior DE.

Jonna: adjusted report for code reviews (High Level perspective)

Jonna and Jasmin: talked about potential issue with on call schedule and post core hours work. 
Here I am emphasizing on DBA(s) slowly but surely taking more active and protective role for ANY prod deployments.
We can talk\discuss more in our weekly meeting.
