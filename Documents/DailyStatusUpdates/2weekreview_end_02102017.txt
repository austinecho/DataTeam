2-Week review - Take #2
-------------------------------

Below are discrepancies for last 2 weeks on all tasks\projects and planned\unplanned items.
Main focus here is to recognize patterns where we could improve on our day-to-day activities
and projects overall.


Overall: better than last review. Focus is missing on % for project\task completion.



-Projects: update % on completion of your involvement.
-Estimations for tasks (code review, replication scripts, consultation requests)

1/30/2017 
DBAs - use this as a model for status

2/7/2017
DBAs - SQL Job Inventory meeting is not a distraction

2/8/2017 -
DBAs - too many distractions not to proceed on projects work?  
	
	

Note to all: 
If you are out, make sure you transfer all knowledge (tasks in flight, people involved)
to your team member, send email to Jonna and CC Jasmin.
Also, notify involved parties that you will be out and who will pick up the slack.
